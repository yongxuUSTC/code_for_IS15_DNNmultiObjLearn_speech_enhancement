Description
Abstract: We propose a multi-objective framework to learn both secondary targets not 
directly related to the intended task of speech enhancement (SE) and the primary target of 
the clean log-power spectra (LPS) features to be used directly for constructing the enhanced 
speech signals. In deep neural network (DNN) based SE we introduce an auxiliary structure 
to learn secondary continuous features, such as mel-frequency cepstral coefficients 
(MFCCs), and categorical information, such as the ideal binary mask (IBM), and integrate ...
